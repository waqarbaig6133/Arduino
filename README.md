The only required components for this project is the board, which is connected to the PC via USB-B, as for all other projects to program the microcontroller. 
The LED is connected to the 13th digital pin, which, like all other digital pins, is used to detect electrical signals. In this case, electrical signals will be generated. Everytime high voltage is generated, the light will turn on 
for 1000ms by writing delay(1000), and the "low" command turns off the voltage to the LED for 1000ms.

The time can be changed individually to whatever up to 4,294,967,295ms, even asynchronously like 100ms on and 1000ms off.
